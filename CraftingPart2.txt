Ok. You may have noticed a few things.

First, it is sleeting outside and I have the doors and windows open. I can explain.

Second, part of the house smells like used cooking oil. I can explain.

Third, part of the house smells like an air freshener factory. I can explain.

Fourth, I may have wax on my pants, shirt, the floor, the counter. I can explain.
You see, it's like this. I get bored. And when I get bored - I try to create.

Sometimes the creative process involves spilling wax. And sometimes you have to heat up the stove to melt that wax. Sometimes a pan of grease is on the stove. That almost always emits a strong odor, which almost always necessitates opening of the doors and windows to air things out.

Those with a very strong creative drive tend to push the crafting envelope. What happens if I break open a can of expanding foam? Well, we answered that already. But, there are always new frontiers, new boundaries, new cans of air freshener to accidentally drill into.

However, let us consider Occam's razor - parsimony, economy, succintness - sometimes the most obvious answer is correct.

The dog did it.
