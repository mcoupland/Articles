What's a developer supposed to do with 2 weeks off?

I decided to try my hand at crafting - specifically mold making. I wanted to try some cheap methods. Clay from corn starch and baking soda. Silicone from Si caulk and dish detergent.

Petroleum jelly makes a great release agent for silicone (painted on pvc). It does not, however, make a good RA for clay. It simply makes it runny, sticky, and un-usable.

Homemade clay sticks to everything and either cracks when it dries or it never dries (see petroleum jelly fiasco).

A three sided box is a bad idea, the medium will spill out the open side. It is not recommended to place your hand in hot wax for molding purposes - your hand will burn and you will fling hot wax everywhere. Incidentally, it is probably a good idea to wear a shirt when crafting so that when you fling hot wax everywhere, your torso is protected.

Hot glue will only glue cardboard and skin. It is very hot - there should be a warning. Once you figure out that you can use it to create cardboard boxes, you become addicted to hot glue.

A cardboard box is not a great container for holding hot wax. The wax will escape from every nook and cranny. As the cardboard heats, it creates more and more nooks and crannies. However, if you only pour small amounts of wax at a time, it will "self-heal." The wax will dry in the nooks and crannies. However, if you pour your entire load of wax in at once, you will find yourself frantically searching for containers with which to catch the draining wax.

Once the wax completely drains - you can take your putty knife and scrape all the wax off your desk and reheat and reuse it.
